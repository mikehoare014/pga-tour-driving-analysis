# PGA Tour Driving Analysis
This project analyzes driving statistics from the PGA tour. The primary objective it to analyze the relationship between driving distance and driving accuracy. 

Driving disance in golf is considered to be a critical skill, and is becoming more popular given the rise of golf superstars such as Brooks Koepa and Bryson Dechambeau, both whom have won major championships. 

However, driving accuracy, defined as a player hitting the fairway, remains just as critical since driving the ball far and out of bounds is not useful.

Hence, as a player hits the ball further, does that have an effect on their driving accuracy? Is there possibly a tradeoff and how severe is this tradeoff?
